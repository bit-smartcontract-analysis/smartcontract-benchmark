Hello World!





We created $EGO token for win-win strategy. Our team provides you the opportunity to buy the token to multiply your investment.

There are no tokens for the team, the contract doesn't have minting function - everything is simple and safe.





Action plan:

1) There will be a presale of the token on Bounce.finance where you can buy it at lower price before listing.

2) After that our team will add liquidity in pool on Uniswap followed by liquidity locking.

3) Get your profit.





Total Supply - 9000 EGO



Public presale details

Supply: 8000 EGO

Price: 1 ETH = 200 EGO  (1 EGO = 0.005 ETH)

Unsold tokens will be burned



Uniswap listing

Liquidity Pool: 10 ETH - 1000 EGO

Price: 1 ETH = 100 EGO (1 EGO = 0.01 ETH)
