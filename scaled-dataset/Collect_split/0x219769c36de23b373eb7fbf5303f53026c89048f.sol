Tokens LINXY

The term crypto token refers to a special virtual currency token or how cryptocurrencies are denominated. These tokens represent fungible and tradable assets or utilities that reside on their own blockchains. Crypto tokens are often used to fundraise for crowd sales, but they can also be used as a substitute for other things. These tokens are usually created, distributed, sold, and circulated through the standard initial coin offering (ICO) process, which involves a crowdfunding exercise to fund project development.

Details Linxy Finance Ecossystem

Linxy Finance (LINXY) Cryptocurrency



The major project update will enable all project users to create smart contracts directly on the LINXY network, so tokens, Dapps and NFTs can be easily created quickly and cheaper than in other blockchains that offer the same service.



With the update the following products or services will be created:



IDLINXY (LINXY Digital Identity).

NodeSH (Node Secure HyperConnection).

Chain LINXY Platform.

LINXY Hub.

NFT LINXY platform.

IDLINXY (LINXY Digital Identity)



Use our IDLINXY app to store your coins, or manage your tokens all in a simple and super secure way.



When creating your account, you will save your private key and export mnemonic (secure words) and then you can access our Android, Web, Chrome or Firefox wallet.



For login the same process is used, use your safe words or private key if you are logged in or forget to login.



NodeSH (Node Secure HyperConnection)



NodeSH: used to interact with the blockchain in reading and writing, these will allow the execution of the Smart Contract and will keep the states of the Smart Contract itself within their database, based on the interactions and rules written within the code .

Virtual Machine: the virtual machine (VM2) allows you to execute “untrusted” code or host of the NodeSH and is the safe environment in which the code is executed. The Virtual Machine will have few, predefined, internal modules available and will be able to interact with the NodeSH database limited to its own sphere of competence.

Compiler: although Smart Contracts are written in Javascript, the compiler will allow you to translate certain predefined rules (such as reading and writing the database) into a native language capable of communicating with the NodeSH.

NodeSH Modules

And here we are at the most important part: the modules. Although we can continue to call them “Smart Contracts” in fact the platform allows you to create modules / extensions / whatever you prefer to call them for the NodeSH. These modules will then be enabled within the NodeSH and then maintained by one or more specific NodeSH. Here we come to the first point on our list of required features: scalability .



The modules are not natively included in all the NodeSH, but only in those that have the interest of maintaining them and therefore the interest in providing more or less computing power for their execution.



This means that a specific application can be maintained only by its creator or by all those interested in using it, this therefore means that the number of interested parties will grow with the increase in users and therefore the system will always have computing power available. to serve different users.



This type of approach has already been used in decentralized applications such as IPFS or Torrent.



Clock and automatism

The specific interaction with the NodeSH allows to solve another big problem encountered in other Smart Contracts platforms, namely the automatisms. While it is generally accepted that the smart contract “executes itself on the basis of specific rules”, this idea is drastically wrong.



Taking the example of Ethereum, a Smart Contract may possibly have “automatically” conditions such that if executed (and we repeat the if ), it will lead to a change of state within it.



This is because the Ethereum Virtual Machine does not have a real clock or a fundamental characteristic of all electronic machines and which allows to synchronize by means of a certain cycle . In computers, for example, it is calculated in Hertz (GHz) and defines the amount to perform operations that the computer can perform every second.



Clearly to extend the concept of clock to the blockchain we must abstract from the concept related to computers and think that the VM clock (i.e. the moment when the machine synchronizes) is the emission of a block, which in the LINXY network is about 1 minute .



This means that we can think of having our Smart Contract execute at least one operation every block, that is when a “cycle” has been concluded.



We have therefore created the basis for the automatisms, all Smart Contracts will be able to call the function onBlock and self-execute the code regardless of whether someone calls or does not call the Smart Contract itself!



Immutability and updatability

Speaking of blockchain and Smart Contract, we can only mention one of the fundamental characteristics that the code must have: immutability.



Immutability is guaranteed by the blockchain as the code is not directly executed from a file, but this file must first be loaded into an address, thanks to the techniques we know. The code executed by the VM and by the user is therefore well defined and static and we have the guarantee that the code has been published by its author thanks to a double signature process.





For trading these tokens we are still looking for partnerships with exchanges, but don’t worry our team has been thinking about various trading strategies for the tokens in our network.



Hope you enjoyed the post, we will create post about our new services to familiarize you with everything that is coming.



Until the next post!







How to Upgrade Your LINX Wallet to Linxy Finance





The new wallets version 1.7.0.0-LINXYProtocol have their data compatible with versions 1.6.0.0, but there were some changes in their directories, to fix it is simple:





1º STEP

Go to :



Windows: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\LINX

Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/LINX

Ubuntu: ~/.LINX (Usually located in the root folder or main directory of your VPS)



Rename .LINX to .LINXY, so it looks like this:

Windows: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\LINXY

Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/LINXY

Ubuntu: ~/.LINXY (Usually located in the root folder or main directory of your VPS)



2º STEP

Go to the directory and look for your LINX.conf file and rename it to LINXY.conf, the rest of the files can continue as is.



If you use the LINX.pid file it must also be renamed in your settings the system will create a new PID file with the name LINXY.pid and you need to rename it





LINXY Virtual Machine (LINXY VM)





This describes the functioning of the LINXY Virtual Machine, the reasons for its creation and the implementation in the context of the NodeSH that will allow you to create and execute “Smart Contracts” (software that are executed and that maintain a state within a decentralized network ) thus creating an indefinite number of new use cases.



Abstract

LINXY was born from a fork of PIVX and rests its blockchain foundations directly on the concepts of Bitcoin (being PIVX a fork of Dash, which in turn is a fork of Bitcoin). This means that within the LINXY blockchain there is no reference to the concept of Smart Contracts.



Although we strongly believe that decentralized applications do not largely need Smart Contracts on the other hand, we realize that there are many other applications that need to work with a strongly decentralized and highly scalable logic. That said, we started thinking about the possibility of allowing third party developers to use our “backend” technology, that is the NodeSH, without actually corrupting them or having to act directly inside the source code.



Up to now, all the applications that required to interact with an “additional” logic have had to create new projects that interact with the NodeSH, thus delegating the maintenance of particular logics to additional software.



After a careful analysis of the various existing Smart Contracts platforms, we tried to define the “qualities” that our system should have:



Scalability: the system must be highly scalable, guaranteeing stability in the use of the platform as its use increases.

Automatism: the system must be able to “self-execute” or perform certain actions in a totally automatic way.

Simplicity: the system must give the developer ease of development without having to learn new programming languages.

Updatability: the system must guarantee the updating of the software while maintaining its immutability.

We believe that the system designed can actually satisfy all the above requirements, in the next paragraphs we will explain how.



NodeSH, VM e compiler

At the basis of the functioning of the platform we have three entities:
